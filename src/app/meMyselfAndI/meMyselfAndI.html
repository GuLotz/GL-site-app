<h2>Hobbies</h2>

  <li>
    I sing in two choirs: "Kammerchor Hofheim" and "Liederkranz Bremthal / Chorisma"
  </li>
  <li>
    I am currently teaching myself some web technology. Originally I had started with TYPO3, but found it too flakey and a too big ship to sail for my purposes.
    So I got back to basics, learned some HTML5, some CSS3, some bootstrap, some typescript and now redesigned the page using angular 5.

  <li>
    I compose music using Cakewalk Sonar X2 Studio. You can find some fragments under the music tab of this site.
